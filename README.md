Exercise solution

## Status of the solution

The implementation should cover the concerns expressed in the exercise enunciation. However, there is much to improve upon in the code: 
* More exception classes, and lots more handling of errors, are needed. 
* There should be profiles for both Spring and Maven, to ease the lifecycle across environments. 
* There is no Docker repository definition, one should be established. 
* There are no comments in the code. While it is mostly self explanatory (as it should), some would be desirable. 
* Unit testing is very limited, it should be greatly expanded. 
* There is no logging implementation, logs should be implemented and generated from the application. 
* Spring security must be configured with an identity provider. 

Most of these things are not here because I thought other aspects of the implementation were more in line with what the test implies as the knowledge areas to be probed.
